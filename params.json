Tests are named according what is tested.\r\n\r\nThe `/incubator` folder is also the place where the prototype modules I develop live. If they prove useful,\r\nthey go into their own repo and get \"submodulized\".\r\n\r\n\r\nCommands\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* `npm i` install all dependencies\r\n* `puer` starts a web server and opens default browser on root\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
