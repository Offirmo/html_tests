I looked through #304 and I guess I am a little confused of what users are asked to do to get Lodash to fit in with…github.com

@jdalton that would require being sure that sinon setup happened before lodash.debounce was loaded. This is tricky to do.

I’m stuck with this problem, wanting to test that an expected debounce is correctly implemented by my code. I’m having a hard time advocating unit tests in my company precisely because of such problems.

Even if you have arguments, removing this useless caching would make our lives easier without harming lodash at all… Caching Date.now makes no sense today.
