# Snow effect for Christmas

Xmas time has a special atmosphere, and you can share it with your website's visitors thanks to a nice module from [Haroen Viaene](https://github.com/Haroenv):

![Snow effect](/floating.gif?raw=true "Optional Title")

Add it to your page code with whatever method you fancy. Simplest solution:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/floating.js@2.6.3/floating.js"></script>
```
(alternative: `yarn add floating.js` + require)

*floating.js* creates fully configurable floating elements on your page. Here is what I used for the snow effect:

```js
floating({
   content: '<span style="color: snow">‚ùÑ</span>',
   number: 25,
   direction: 'reverse',
   size: [0.5, 2.5],
 })
```

However, with a different config, you can have several effects: [demo](https://haroen.me/floating.js/).

Merry Christmas to everyone !
